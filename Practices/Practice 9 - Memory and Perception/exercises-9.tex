\begin{exercise}{0}{Optical illusions}{0.5}
Your task is to find and explain an example of an optical illusion, which has an explanation of what causes it.
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0em
	\item Find a picture of a video with the illusion you find interesting.
	\item Describe what is happening (how our perception is wrong).
	\item Explain what can be the reason behind this illusion, what is the neural mechanism, which prevents us from seeing things as they really are.
	\item How this misperception can affect our everyday life? Why evolution decided to introduce this flaw in our system?
\end{itemize}
